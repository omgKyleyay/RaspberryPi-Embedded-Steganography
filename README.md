A new embedded steganography project using a linear feed shift register integrated within. This application was designed to be used on a
RaspberryPi, although it can be altered fairly easily to be used on a desktop PC.
This application will, using image steganography and the linear feed shift register, produce an embedded image that is ready to be AES 
encrypted and sent to an email of the user's choice.

To run, begin the Main.java class and choose the encrypt method. The interface will allow you to choose a host image and a guest image that
you want hidden. Make sure the host image is 8x larger than the guest image. The rest is quite intuitive as every button is labeled.
